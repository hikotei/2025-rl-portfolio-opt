# Explanation of Backtesting in `drl_train_sliding_window_jules.ipynb`

This document explains the backtesting process in the `drl_train_sliding_window_jules.ipynb` notebook, focusing on the environment creation and the core backtesting methodology.

## Backtesting Environment Creation

In the original notebook, the backtesting phase for each window involved setting up two distinct environment instances:

1.  **`env_test`**: This is the primary environment for backtesting. It is initialized using the specific **test dataset** (prices, returns, volatility) for the current sliding window. The agent's performance is evaluated on this environment to simulate trading on unseen data.

2.  **`temp_env_for_load_init`**: This environment was created with a small slice of the **training dataset**. Its main purpose was to satisfy the initialization requirements of the `DRLAgent` wrapper class. The `DRLAgent` constructor (`__init__`) expected an environment object to determine structural parameters like observation and action spaces, and to set up its internal mechanisms (like `SubprocVecEnv` for vectorized environments, even if only one environment was effectively used for loading/evaluation).

The workflow was:
*   Create `env_test`.
*   Create `temp_env_for_load_init`.
*   Instantiate `DRLAgent` using `temp_env_for_load_init`: `best_agent_loaded = DRLAgent(env=temp_env_for_load_init, ...)`.
*   Load the actual pre-trained PPO model into this `DRLAgent` instance, crucially telling the PPO model to use `env_test`: `best_agent_loaded.load(path=MODEL_PATH, env=env_test)`.

The extensive comments in the notebook around this section were an attempt to clarify this multi-step process, which was necessary due to the design of the `DRLAgent` wrapper and how it interacted with the underlying Stable Baselines3 `PPO.load` method. The key was ensuring the loaded PPO model was correctly associated with `env_test` for the actual evaluation, despite `DRLAgent` being initialized with `temp_env_for_load_init`.

## Suitability of Resetting the Training Environment

Simply resetting the training environment is **not suitable** for the backtesting phase due to the distinct data periods used in a sliding window approach:

*   **Training Environment**: Configured with the training dataset for a specific window (e.g., years 2006-2010).
*   **Validation Environment**: Configured with the validation dataset (e.g., year 2011).
*   **Test Environment (Backtesting)**: Must be configured with the test dataset (e.g., year 2012).

An environment object in this project (`PortfolioEnv`) is initialized with specific dataframes (prices, returns, vola). The `reset()` method on an environment typically resets its internal state (like the current timestep, portfolio value, etc.) but **does not change the underlying data source** it was configured with.

Therefore, to evaluate an agent on the test data, a new environment instance explicitly configured with that test data must be created.

## Core Idea of the Sliding Window Backtest

The notebook implements a **sliding window (or walk-forward) backtesting** methodology. This is a common technique to assess the performance of a trading strategy over time, simulating how it would have been trained and deployed historically. The core idea is as follows:

1.  **Define Window Structure**: The total dataset is divided into a series of overlapping "windows." Each window consists of three periods:
    *   **Training Period**: Data used to train the DRL agent (e.g., 5 years).
    *   **Validation Period**: Data used to select the best performing agent out of potentially several trained agents (e.g., the year following training). This period is "unseen" during training.
    *   **Testing Period (Backtest Period)**: Data used to evaluate the chosen best agent. This period is "unseen" during both training and validation, providing an out-of-sample performance measure (e.g., the year following validation).

2.  **Iterate Through Windows**:
    *   For the first window, an agent (or multiple agents with different random seeds) is trained on the training data.
    *   The best agent is selected based on its performance on the validation data (e.g., highest mean reward).
    *   This selected best agent is then evaluated on the test data, and its performance metrics are recorded. This is the "backtest" for this specific window.

3.  **Slide the Window**: The entire three-period window (train, validate, test) is then shifted forward in time (e.g., by one year). The process (train, validate, test) is repeated.
    *   In this notebook, the agent trained in the new window can be "seeded" with the weights of the best agent from the previous window's test phase, allowing for continuous learning.

4.  **Aggregate Results**: After processing all windows, the backtest results from each testing period are aggregated to provide an overall assessment of the trading strategy's robustness and performance across different market conditions.

This walk-forward approach is more rigorous than a single train-test split because it repeatedly tests the strategy's ability to adapt to new data and avoid overfitting to a specific period.
